## 🧩 Project Overview

Empower Ability Labs is a fully accessible, responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project was developed with a strong focus on **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA** and **ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)**.

## 📌 Features & Requirements

### 1. **Single-Page App Functionality**
- Focus management for dynamic content.
- Unique page titles for each section.
- URL history management (Back button support).

### 2. **Layout Design**
- Fully responsive layout using Bootstrap 5 (no Bootstrap JS used).
- High-contrast and user-friendly color schemes.

### 3. **HTML Semantics**
- Proper use of semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Logical content flow and heading structure.

### 4. **Interactive Components**
All components were built **without Bootstrap JS** and follow **ARIA standards**:
- Accessible navigation bar
- Lightbox/Modal dialog
- Custom Switch component
- Show/Hide form (event form)

### 5. **Web Form Accessibility**
- Fully keyboard-navigable form.
- Proper labeling and use of ARIA roles.
- Client-side validation for required fields and input types.
- Clear user notifications for errors and successful submission.

## ♿ Accessibility Testing

- **Screen Reader**: Verified with NVDA for correct announcements and navigation.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Fully tested for focus indicators, navigation, and interaction.
- **Color Contrast**: Checked using accessibility tools to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

---

## 🔧 Challenges & Solutions

- **Focus Management**: Managed focus shifts using JavaScript when navigating between sections.
- **Component Accessibility**: Built ARIA-compliant components from scratch (modal, switch, etc.) without relying on Bootstrap JS.
- **Form Validation**: Used custom JavaScript to provide real-time error handling with screen reader-friendly messages.
- **Toggle Button Challenge**: Faced difficulty implementing an accessible toggle switch using standard JavaScript.  
  👉 **Solution**: Instead of a traditional toggle, we used two images (on/off states) and created a custom JavaScript function that mimics toggle behavior. This workaround maintained both interactivity and accessibility.
